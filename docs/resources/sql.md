  This resource allows for the execution of arbitrary SQL statements against an Oracle database. It is a 'write-only' resource, meaning it only performs the SQL execution during creation and does not manage the state of the executed SQL. It is recommended to use create_before_destroy = true in the lifecycle block to ensure that a new SQL statement is executed before an old one is 'deleted' (which is a no-op).
